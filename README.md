# What?

I know that's a frequent question here. This repo stores an Arch Linux custom installation made by me to automate the installation process when I'm really busy or simply don't want to install Arch in the Archway.

## Why it's public then?

The only reason is that downloading and running the script is way easier from GitHub in a live boot environment.

## Can I use this script?

If you know what are you doing, go ahead. Otherwise, be aware because it could make you lose data or your current settings.

## How can I install Arch Linux?

If you are a newbie using Linux, I highly recommend going for an Arch-based distro instead, such as [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), and [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/). Once you feel comfortable using Linux, try installing Arch Linux in the Archway.

### Using a script

You can try an unofficial installation script made by the Arch Linux community:

- https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall
- https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi

I'd never use these.

### Using a Virtual Machine (VM)

You can try safely installing Arch Linux by using a VM (Virtual Machine) over your current OS, something like a GNU/Linux installation inside Windows that you can use whatever you want, this action may increase your computer's resource usage, which could result in decreased performance and slower processing speeds.

For doing this you can use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).
